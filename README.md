# Customer-Support-Automation


This project aimed to streamline customer support by integrating AI-driven automation into service workflows. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models were employed to analyze incoming queries, classify intents, and generate context-aware responses in real time. A knowledge base and rule-based fallback system ensured accuracy and reliability in addressing customer concerns. The automation reduced average response time by over 40% while maintaining high customer satisfaction levels. Overall, the system improved efficiency, lowered support costs, and provided a scalable solution for handling large volumes of customer requests.
